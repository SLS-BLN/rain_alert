### üß† How a partial function works
This is detailed explanation generated by AI.

    # Pure function: loads config without side effects
    load_config = partial(dotenv_values, ".env")

---

### üîç What It Does

This line defines a **pure function** named `load_config` that, when called, loads environment variables from a file named `.env`. It uses `functools.partial` to pre-fill the argument of the `dotenv_values` function.

---

### üß© Components Explained

#### 1. `dotenv_values`

- Comes from the `python-dotenv` package.
- Reads a `.env` file and returns a dictionary of key-value pairs.

    Example `.env` file:

        API_KEY=abc123
        LATITUDE=52.52
        LONGITUDE=13.405

    Result of `dotenv_values(".env")`:

        {
            "API_KEY": "abc123",
            "LATITUDE": "52.52",
            "LONGITUDE": "13.405"
        }

#### 2. `partial` from `functools`

- `partial` is used to **pre-fill arguments** of a function.
- It returns a new function with some arguments already set.

    Equivalent code:

        def load_config():
            return dotenv_values(".env")

#### 3. Pure Function

- A **pure function**:
  - Has no side effects (doesn‚Äôt modify external state).
  - Always returns the same output for the same input.

    `load_config()` is pure because it just reads a file and returns its contents as a dictionary ‚Äî no mutation, no I/O beyond reading.

---

### ‚úÖ Why This Is Smart

- **Reusability**: You can now call `load_config()` anywhere in your code without repeating the file path.
- **Testability**: Pure functions are easier to test and debug.
- **Clarity**: It abstracts away the implementation detail of loading config.

---

### üß™ Example Usage

    config = load_config()
    print(config["API_KEY"])

This would print the value of `API_KEY` from your `.env` file.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Optional Enhancement

If you wanted to make it even more flexible, you could wrap it in a function that accepts a filename:

    def load_config(filename=".env"):
        return dotenv_values(filename)

But your current use of `partial` is clean and idiomatic for fixed config paths.

### üßæ Summary

This line is a concise, functional way to define a reusable config loader. It leverages Python‚Äôs functional programming tools to improve clarity, maintainability, and testability ‚Äî all in one elegant line.
